                Digital Marketing strategies varies across categories and across businesses.
                Each business requires it's own Digital Marketing Strategy.
                Ideally, to start with, you need to have your objectives clearly defined.
                Once you have identified the value proposition for your prospects and the
                communication strategy defined, you can start with the execution part.
                In terms of execution, you need to create a Landing Page or a Web Page
                with appropriate lead capturing mechanism. Once done, the objective is
                then to get and consistently bring the relevant users to the page.
                The interested users can get in touch with you and you can now start
                engaging with the users.
