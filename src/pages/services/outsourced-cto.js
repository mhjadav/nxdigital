                  The primary role of software for any business is to automate the processes.
                  This reduces human efforts and increases efficiency. Moreover,
                  human errors are eliminated when the tasks are performed by software.
                  Typically, software requirements vary from business to business and
                  customised software can be developed specifically tailor-made to meet
                  your requirements. A lot of times, software readily available can also
                  be used to get rid of highly mechanical tasks especially like certain
                  aspects of Accounting, Inventory Management and PoS (Point of Sales).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For larger businesses, two key software required are: Enterprise Resource
                  Planning Software (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management Software (CRM).
                  ERP facilitates seamless communication across business verticals and CRM
                  ensures customer engagement and retention.

                  Technology is constantly evolving and picking the right technology
                  to develop your software is quite a challenge. There are several
                  factors to be considered while selecting the right technology.
                  Some of these factors include security, costs, advantages,
                  disadvantages, licensing fees, downtime tolerance etc.
