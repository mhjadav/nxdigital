                              Step 1: Our tech team developed a landing page as per the client's
                              specification, where we put in all the relevant information about
                              Finlearn Academy's services along with a lead collection form.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                            Step 2: Our graphic designers created the artwork (pic) which was
                            then promoted on Social Media channel LinkedIn and through the Search
                            and Display networks of Google Ads.
                      </p>

The leads flowing through are filtered and the client's sales
                        team then starts meaningful conversations for closure.
